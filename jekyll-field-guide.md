    <p>Yeah me too. Like you, I have built websites in the past because I wanted to share things I cared about with others. But I always got sidetracked by all the things I had to do to maintain the software running the site &mdash; Wordpress.</p>
    <p>Then one day, 3 years ago I discovered Jekyll, a static-site generator and have never looked back! Jekyll made making websites fun again and has allowed me to focus on what matters most to me &mdash; design and content.</p>
