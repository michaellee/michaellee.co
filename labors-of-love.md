I enjoy creating things. Here is a list of the things &ndash; my labors of love &ndash; I've created.

<h2 class="mt2"><a href="http://michaellee.co/tap-and-click">Tap &amp; Click</a></h2>

Have you ever used an app and wondered who made this awesome app? I have. I noticed that often I discovered the designer or developer behind an app completely by accident. This happened because I stumbled across their blog or perhaps their profile on Dribbble. 

I created _Tap &amp; Click_ as an index of sorts celebrating the makers of incredible apps that I use and admire.

_Tap &amp; Click_ is my first Ember.js application and is open source for contribution.

<h2 class="mt2"><a href="https://github.com/michaellee/chicken">Chicken</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/michaellee/waffles">Waffles</a></h2>
If you look at a waffle, you realize that the lines that are imprinted in a waffle resemble a grid. That's the inspiration behind the name of my CSS grid library, Waffles. To complement Waffles, I also created a CSS utility library called Chicken.

Yup, I named my CSS utility and grid libraries after a southern dish. It's delicious.

_Chicken and Waffles_ is based on the <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki" target="_blank">principles of OOCSS</a>.

<h2 class="mt2"><a href="http://www.edisonunion.com" target="_blank">Edison Union</a></h2>

As a creative I find inspiration from many sources on the internet. And I must admit at times the amount gets daunting. _Edison Union_ is a place where my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisliamlai">Christopher Lai</a> and I curate the things that inspires us to share with others.

_Edison Union_ is also a place where we create original content such as writings, interviews and products.

_Edison Union_ is a custom built blog/ecommerce platform built by Christopher and I in Ruby on Rails and utilizes the Sass/CSS libraries called, Chicken and Waffles.

<h2 class="mt2"><a href="http://www.nativehaus.com" target="_blank">native haus</a></h2>

Ever been in a relationship where the other person spoke a different language then your own? If you said yes, have you ever tried buying them a card in their language? I have and I discovered that there are very limited, if not zero options.

So [my wife and I created a paper goods business](http://michaellee.co/native-haus/) to fulfill that need. It's called _native haus_.

We create original, paper goods for the language of your heart.

_native haus_ is built on the Ruby static site-generator, Jekyll and processes orders with Gumroad.

<h2 class="mt2"><a href="https://www.printsquares.com" target="_blank">Print Squares</a></h2>

Instagram is pretty cool. Having prints of your Instagrams is even cooler. _Print Squares_ is an Instagram printing service.

Print Squares was my first journey into Ruby programming. Along the way I partned up with my buddy, Christopher Lai and turned it into a pretty sweet Ruby on Rails application. Print Squares utilized the Instagram api and processed transactions with Stripe.

In March 2014, [we sold Print Squares for $1](http://michaellee.co/sold-business-for-dollar/). From the whole experience of _Print Squares_ I learned tons about programming, business, customer service and printing.
