# About

Hey there! I'm Michael.

I live in the Triangle. 

By night (and early mornings), together with a buddy of mine, we run a [software company called Herelde](http://www.herelde.com) that makes nice things.

By day, I'm a front-end architect at a company that [enables music artists](http://www.reverbnation.com) to pursue their dreams.

I share [tips and tricks](http://www.appmanuals.com) that I've found useful on the iPhone, iPad and Mac.

My curriculum vitae can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellomichaellee).

This site is where I mostly chronicle life and things I geek out about.
