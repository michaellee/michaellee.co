# About

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1228961/michaellee/us.jpeg" alt="NJL and Me" class="About-profile">

Hey there! I'm Michael.

I live in Cary, North Carolina. 

By night (and early mornings), together with a buddy of mine, we run a [software company called Herelde](http://www.herelde.com) that makes nice things.

By day, I'm a front-end architect at a company that [enables music artists](http://www.reverbnation.com) to pursue their dreams.

My curriculum vitae can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellomichaellee).

This site is where I mostly chronicle life and things I geek out about.
