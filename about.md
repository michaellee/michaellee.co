Hey there, I'm Michael Lee. Thanks for visiting my site!

My favorite food is pizza, I'm a stay-at-home dad and a freelance developer &amp; designer based out of Cary, North Carolina.

I enjoy learning and sharing my knowledge of programming, which is why I built [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io) &mdash; a community for developers to share programming tips, ask questions and help each other grow in their craft.

In the past I've worked for NC State University as a senior web developer, ReverbNation as a front-end developer and Pathos Ethos as a software developer. I've also had the pleasure of doing work for companies and brands such as University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Carolina Hurricanes and !deation.

I designed and built this site to house writings about being a family man, building products and cool stuff that I'm interested in.
