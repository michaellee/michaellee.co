Hey there! I'm Michael.

I'm husband, a father, a front-end developer at <a href="http://reverbnation.com" target="_blank">ReverbNation</a>, [designer and maker of apps](http://michaellee.co/labors-of-love/), [a writer](http://www.edisonunion.com) and a [paper goods](http://www.nativehaus.com) maker from Cary, North Carolina.

I designed and built this site to house writings that chronicle life, knowledge I'm gaining as a developer and things I geek out about.

If you'd like to learn a little more about me, check out [this interview](http://onefoursev.co/post/81582843046/michael-lee) that Brandon Houlihan of 147 did.
