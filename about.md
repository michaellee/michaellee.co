Hey there! I'm Michael.

I'm a husband, a father, a senior web developer at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu" target="_blank">NC State University</a>, [designer and maker of apps](http://michaellee.co/labors-of-love/), a writer at [Edison Union](http://www.edisonunion.com) and a paper goods maker at [native haus](http://www.nativehaus.com) from Cary, North Carolina.

I designed and built this site to house writings that chronicle life, knowledge I'm gaining as a developer and things I geek out about.

If you'd like to learn a little more about me, check out [this interview](http://onefoursev.co/post/81582843046/michael-lee) that Brandon Houlihan of 147 did.
