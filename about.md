Hey there! I'm Michael.

I'm a husband, a father and a freelance developer &amp; designer based out of Cary, North Carolina.

I enjoy learning and sharing my knowledge of programming, which is why I built [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io) &mdash; a community where developers of all skill-sets help each other solve problems, learn new skills and become better at their craft. If you're a programmer, you should come join and level up your skills.

My wife is wickedly good at crafting things with her hands and together we sell paper goods online at [native haus](http://www.nativehaus.com).

In the past I've worked for NC State University as a senior web developer, ReverbNation as a front-end developer and PathosEthos as a software developer.

I designed and built this site to house writings about building an online community, making products, online business, and being a family man.

This site is built with good ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. The site's theme is a modified version of Brent Jackson's [Heather](http://jxnblk.com/Heather/). It is compiled with a Ruby static-site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Hosted and version-controlled on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaellee/michaellee.github.io).
