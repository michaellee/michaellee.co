Hey there! I'm Michael.

I'm a husband, a father and a freelance developer &amp; designer based out of Cary, North Carolina. 

I enjoy learning and sharing my programming knowledge, which is why I built <a href="https://www.codehive.io" target="_blank">CodeHive</a> &mdash; a community where developers of all skill sets help each other solve problems, learn new skills and become better at their craft. If you're a programmer, you should come join and level up your skills.

My wife is wickedly good at making things with her hands and together we sell paper goods online at <a href="http://www.nativehaus.com" target="_blank">native haus</a>.

In the past I've worked for <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu" target="_blank">NC State University</a> as a senior web developer, <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com" target="_blank">ReverbNation</a> as a front-end developer and <a href="http://www.pathosethos.com" target="_blank">PathosEthos</a> as a software developer.

I designed and built this site to house writings that chronicle life, knowledge I'm gaining as a developer and things I geek out about.

<h2 class="mt2">Colophon</h2>

This site is built with good ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. The CSS gets help from an OOCSS library I created called <a href="https://github.com/Herelde/chicken-and-waffles" target="_blank">chicken and waffles</a>. It is compiled with a Ruby static-site generator, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Hosted and version-controlled on <a href="https://github.com/michaellee/michaellee.github.io">GitHub</a>. The typeface is set in Avenir Next and Georgia.
