Hey there! I'm Michael.

I'm a husband, a father and a freelance developer &amp; designer based out of Cary, North Carolina.

I enjoy learning and sharing my knowledge of programming, which is why I built [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io) &mdash; a community where developers of all skill sets help each other solve problems, learn new skills and become better at their craft. If you're a programmer, you should come join and level up your skills.

My wife is wickedly good at crafting things with her hands and together we sell paper goods online at [native haus](http://www.nativehaus.com).

In the past I've worked for [NC State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) as a senior web developer, [ReverbNation](http://www.reverbnation.com) as a front-end developer and [PathosEthos](http://www.pathosethos.com) as a software developer.

I designed and built this site to house writings about building an online community, making products, online business, eating healthy and being a family man.

## Colophon

This site is built with good ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. The site's theme is a modified version of Brent Jackson's [Heather](http://jxnblk.com/Heather/). It is compiled with a Ruby static-site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Hosted and version-controlled on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaellee/michaellee.github.io). The typeface is set in [Merriweather](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather).
