> No, try not. Do or do not, there is no try.
> - Yoda

I've been listening to Michael Hyatt's podcast lately and this episode was challenging to listen to. The meat of the podcast is that trying is a way out of commitment. For example, a parent can't say, "Let's give this parenting thing a try". With parenting you can't return your kids if they drive you nuts and you want to give up. Once you become a parent you're committed to their wellbeing and raising them.

Michael challenges his audience to remove the word try from their vocabulary because it shows that you're not committed to whatever you say you're going to try and that there is a way out. I thought about this in my own life and I found it to be true.

Whenever I said I'd give it a shot, I realized that the level of seriousness in my commitment to that thing I was going to try just wasn't that deep or even there.

After listening to the episode, I spoke with my wife and talked about things that for years I told her we'd give it a try. That now, I want to change the try to either do or not do. Immediately I realized the weight of the committment was &mdash; as Marty McFly says &mdash; **heavy**.
