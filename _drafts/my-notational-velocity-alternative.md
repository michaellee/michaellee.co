Years ago, I discovered a neat little Mac app called Notational Velocity. It was a simple application that got out of the way to simply allow you to capture your notes.

I loved that all my notes were located in a single place, quickly searchable and the interface was minimalistic. Another plus was being able to save all files as simple .txt files in Drobox so that I could have access to my files from anywhere.

Eventually, Notational Velocity stopped being updated by its original author and a fork was maintained by Brett Terpstra and David Halter called NVAlt. The duo did an excellent job extending the base of Notational Velocity
