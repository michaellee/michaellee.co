title: "Sharing My Journey as a Programmer"
category: programming life
---

Last week, I had the great privilage of being a guest lecturer for [Dr. Christopher Parnin](http://www.chrisparnin.me/)'s software engineering graduate class at NC State University.

This was a treat for me because NC State is my alma mater. Never had I imagined that I would return to the same classroom that I had taken classes in to share with future students.

Before the lecture, Dr. Parnin sent me a list of topics that the students might enjoy hearing about. Looking over the list, there were various topics I wanted to hit but I knew that the amount of content could be overwhelming or just fragmented and confusing.

To make my talk cohesive, I thought it would be best to interweave bits and pieces of various topics into an overarching story. That story is about my journey as a programmer.

The title of my talk was, "Small, Medium, Large and Tiny". I shared about how I got into programming, my experiences with four different companies and a couple of lessons I learned throughout my time at each company.

A few of observations that I had about myself as a speaker:
- Probably want to use a clicker next time, so I'm not going back and forth between the laptop and the spot where I usually stood when speaking
- I think I talk with my hands a lot
- I enjoy speaking in front of people
- Don't use background colors that aren't high contrast, colors are washed out on overheads

Another observation that I had, was something that occurred as well when I was a student. When the speaker finished their talk and opened up the room to questions, you could hear crickets &mdash;
