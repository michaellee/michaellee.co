## The observations

In this section I wanted to highlight, or more like brain dump some thoughts and observations I've made over the past year in running CodeHive.

### Building a community is hard work

I'll admit, building a community is freaking hard. My na√Øve self thought, I could just toss up a website, put up a link to a few existing social media outlets and then boom! Reap the benefits. But in reality it is far from the truth.

Garnering and nurturing a community is *hard* work. Getting people excited about what you're doing and consistently having them come back and contribute to the community ain't easy.

Over the past year, I've posted over 130 boards on CodeHive. I did this because, in order for others to take our product seriously, I needed to take our product seriously. And I did. I've done my best to post a few times a week. What this yielded was a ton of organic traffic from search engines.

### Building CodeHive is hard

There are a ton of features and things we've wanted to build for and into CodeHive. But the reality we face is, if we build or make any of those things will folks use it? Both Christopher and I work full-time jobs. I've got a wife and kids, meaning our time is super limited. Building features and coming up with cool projects for CodeHive takes time.

We would love to invest our time and energy into those things, but the truth is, there is no incentive as of right now. As it currently stands, CodeHive serves the initial purpose for which it was built for. Which is to ask questions and share programming knowledge.

And when I say incentive, I don't mean the dollar bills ya'll. I truly mean that. We've been eating the cost of running CodeHive since day one and have not earned a single penny since that day.

What I mean by incentive is folks interacting and actually participating in CodeHive. You see, when folks participate in the community it acts as accountability/feedback loop. As we see the behavior of users with our site, we could make tweaks and adjustments. Plus, the more peeps that use the site, the more feedback we'd get be it negative or positive both would motivate us in making CodeHive even better.

### It ain't about the dollar bills ya'll

Actually it is and isn't. It is about the dollar bills in the sense, Christopher and I would love if CodeHive paid it's own bills. As of right now the bills are paid from our pockets and our other web products we've built through our company, Herelde. It is in the sense, that Christopher and I would love to make a living out of things that we've built and others have found useful or meaningful. That would allow us to pour more time and energy into our products.

It isn't in the fact that we would never ever toss up ugly ads to just make a penny. We care about the experience too much of our users. No one wants to look at visual barf and neither do we. So no ads. Well, that is unless it's someone like Carbon Ads, that provide elegant and relevant ads, we just haven't hit the monthly sessions requirement...yet ;)

There are 3 ideas we've thought about around with that I'm interested in exploring more on, building CodeHive branded products, sponsorship and job board.

What a CodeHive product could look like are either tutorial videos for things like building web applications with Rails or Ember.js. Or running in person workshops for a fee. We've also thought about doing a pro level account that would provide access to exclusive pro level features like virtual office hours or a private Slack channel to get live help/feedback on programming.

What a sponsorship could look like is having a spot on CodeHive, where a sponsor could place an ad for their product or service for a fee. We also have a our Twitter account and a newsletter to also share about our sponsors. This option would allow us to circumvent the requirements of joining an existing ad networks and allow us to filter what ads get served up on CodeHive. If you're reading this and have a product or service that CodeHive users could potentially benefit from, [hit me up](mailto:hello@codehive.io) and we can discuss about a potential sponsorship.

The job board idea, is something we thought about since day one. Where we'd offer companies the ability to post programming jobs up for our users to apply for.

### There are folks out there who are way smarter than me

Running CodeHive has humbled me a ton. If I ever feel like a hot shot programmer, I just sign on and check out Zeke's profile and Board postings. The guy is 2 decades younger than me and

### I am so darn thankful for anyone who has ever visited or used CodeHive
