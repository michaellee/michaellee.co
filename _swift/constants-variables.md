Almost every character you like can be used for constant and variable names. Names cannot start with numbers.

## Constants
In Swift, constants are declared with the `let` keyword.

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello"
```

## Variables
Variables are declared with the `var` keyword.

```javascript
var name = "Michael"
```

## Printing Constants and Variables
To print a variable or constant use the `println` function.

```javascript
println("The compiled string is \(greeting) \(name)")
```

Swift uses _string interpolation_ to include variables and constants in a string.
