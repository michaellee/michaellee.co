    <p>Yeah me too. Like you, I have built websites in the past because I wanted to share things I cared about with others. But I always got sidetracked by all the things I had to do to maintain the software running the site.</p>
    <p>Then one day, 3 years ago I discovered Jekyll, a static-site generator and have never looked back! Jekyll made making websites fun again and has allowed me to focus on what matters most to me &mdash; design and content.</p>

    <h2 class="serif">What is Jekyll?</h2>
    <p>Jekyll is a static-site generator written in Ruby. This means it lets you take simple text files (think markdown, you are using markdown right?) and make a website with it. Neat right? There's no databases, no updates and no viruses. Woohooo!</p>

    <h2 class="serif">Why are you writing this book?</h2>
    <p>My personal site has been running on Jekyll for the past 3 years. I'm currently in the process of redesigning and rebuilding it. Along the way I'm documenting all the details of how I'm building my site with Jekyll.</p>
    <p>In doing so I'm sharing all my tips and tricks that I've learned building sites with Jekyll so that you can build yours <b>faster and awesomer!</b></p>
