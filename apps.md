This is a curated list of apps I use on a daily basis. I try to keep this list as current as possible. The purpose of this list is to hopefully help you in discovering apps that could improve your productivity. If you've found an app that is better than what's listed below, [let me know!](mailto:hellomichaellee@gmail.com?subject=Check%20this%20app%20out!)

## Desktop
__[Gmail Offline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-offline/ejidjjhkpiempkbhmpbfngldlkglhimk)__
Offline is a Google Chrome App that allows you to read and write emails in the browser, offline. I first heard of Offline from Ev Williams' <a href="https://medium.com/@ev/8e3ed95b533c" target="_blank">Medium article</a>. In it Ev describes how Offline coupled with Gmail shortcuts allows him to fly through emails. I gave it a shot myself and I feel like it has made going through email less painful.

Here's a list of things I really enjoy about using Offline:

- _Quick:_ Offline syncs when you're online. I use Offline even when I'm online and it seems to respond quicker than the normal Gmail interface.
- _Clean layout:_ Offline's layout is in my opinion more streamlined. In the description it says that it took inspiration from Gmail's tablet interface. I find it easier to navigate and read.
- _Less distracting:_ This one is actually huge for me. One of the things that I did a while back on my iPhone was turn off push-notifications. In doing so my stress level seems to have gone down. At work I used Mail.app and I'd get bombarded with notices all day through Notification Center that I had incoming emails. Another feature I like is an absense of a new email count in Offline's tab which is present in regular Gmail. This means Offline just sits there all day waiting for me to check when I choose to.

## iPhone
__[Sunrise](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-for-google/id599114150?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l9EG)__ [Calendar app]
On the desktop my goto calendar app has been Fantastical. It's nimble and its natural language parser is pretty neat. On the iPhone I prefer to use Sunrise. While many folks swear by Fantastical for the iPhone, I never got used to the UI and it always felt like some features were missing.

So I defaulted in using iOS' Calendar app until I discovered Sunrise. The folks behind Sunrise have really thought through its features. A few that I'd like to highlight that I've found really useful are:

- _Waze integration:_ My preferred GPS app on my phone is Waze. When someone invites me to an event and provides the location of the event, Sunrise gives you the option to open up the location right in Waze.
- _Close integration with Google products:_ Although the interface is different, Sunrise provides a lot of the same bits of information that I've become familiar with in Google products. For example when an event is created and there are multiple attendees invited, you can see who has accepted the invitation.
- _Date:_ Apple's Calendar app on the iPhone shows the current date on its icon. Since third-party apps aren't allowed the same level of live information on the iPhone, Sunrise has cleverly used the app's badge to allow users to see the current date.
- _Convenient UI:_ I often scan through events in my calendar, Sunrise provides an easy way to quickly jump back to the current day. Want to connect with folks after an event you were invited to? Sunrise provides a connect button pulling up any social media accounts associated with an event.
