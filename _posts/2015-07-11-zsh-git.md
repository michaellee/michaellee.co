I'm a big fan of Oh My Zsh, which provides you with the Zsh shell and comes with a bunch of plugins to give your command line superpowers.

As a developer, I'm constantly working with git throughout my day and typing out the same commands over and over again can be tedious. Thankfully Oh My Zsh provides short aliases to shorten the amount of typing you do for all the git commands. It is sweet and my fingers are thanking me.
