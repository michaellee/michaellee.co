There's an auto shop that I visit from time to time. At this shop, there's an elderly man who occassionally helps me checkout with my items. I always ask him how his day is going so far and he always replies with the same response and a huge grin on his face.

> I'm having a good day because I'm here.

His response always reminds me to be thankful for the simple things I take for granted everyday. That even if I'm having a bad day, I should take a breath and be thankful for just that &ndash; the ability to take a breath, to be alive.

So simple.
