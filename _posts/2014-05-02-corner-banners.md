title: "Stop Using Corner Banners"
---

Once in a while I come across a site that uses a corner banner to link elsewhere. This is a problem. Depending on the size of my browser, the banner will get in the way of my interaction with the site.

Not cool...

The reason why this happens, is that graphic is bound to a square space. Although the graphic is just a banner, the graphic that encases the banner has a bounding box that takes up space to the furthest pixels.

A quick solution I thought up was just styling a link element and rotating it with some CSS.
