Sometimes you have to stop and just have some fun. Whip out some crayons, markers, scissors, paper and tape; tap into your inner kid and have fun creating anything.

Tonight I grabbed my iPad, launched open <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target="_blank">Paper</a> and created my rendition of a furry blue character.

Drawing isn't anything super technical like what I encounter in my day to day work. But I have a fondness for watercolor and it was fun.
