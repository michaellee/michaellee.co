There's this saying.

> Rome wasn't built in a day.

In my understanding it means, if you're trying to build something substantial it takes time.

The more I build, the more I program, the older I get, I've come to realize this to be true. In the past, I would get these spur of the moment ideas and try to execute in a day or two. But what this yielded was usually poor execution of the idea, exhaustion, a pissed off spouse and a lot of frustration.

I still try to sprint when I should be pacing myself in a marathon, but I'm learning more and more to slow things down.

If I'm spending too much time trying to solve a problem I'm having, I've learned to go do something else for a while and come back. Discovering that my mind actually is still trying to solve the problem even though I'm not actively trying to solve the problem.

If I'm up late, thinking that another cup of joe at 10pm is the solution to get something done, I just close the lid on my computer and go to bed.

If wifey is pissed off at me, it's probably because I've put work or projects as a priority over time with my family and I need to step away and find balance again.

If I'm constantly cursing and hating life because I can't solve a problem or figure out how something is done, I have to remind myself that some things are hard and it is ok that I don't get it the first time, it doesn't mean I'm a failure. Sometimes it clicks the second, third or even fourth time around. Flexing unused muscles hurts at first, but keep doing it and it gets easier.

Rome wasn't built in a day, slow things down, step away and replenish. It'll make what you're building or solving a lot better, your spouse will be a lot happier, you'll be a lot happier and healthier.
