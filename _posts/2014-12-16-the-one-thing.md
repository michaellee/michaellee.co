I've recently started the habit of listing out my daily tasks and prioritizing the tasks that help me feel like I've accomplished something that day. I've found that the tasks that I tend to prioritize the highest are tasks that allows me to be creative or tasks that helps me learn something new.

Creative tasks usually take the shape of either writing for this site, sharing something new I've learned on [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io) or designing and writing code for CodeHive. While tasks that helps me learn something new, usually consists of reading a book.

I've found that when I've checked off tasks that fall into either of these two categories, I feel pretty good about myself and feel like I've accomplished something that day.

What is __the one thing__ that you must do that helps you feel accomplished for the day?
