I've been running across some [excellent free resources]({{site.url}}/python-automation/) to learn programming. Thought I'd keep a [list of them on CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io/boards/EBAz0FU) for anyone looking to learn. If you know of a free resource, feel free to leave a comment and I'll add it to the list.
