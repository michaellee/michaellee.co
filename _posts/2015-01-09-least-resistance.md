I really enjoy [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/) and [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/) by Leo Babauta. The design of the sites are simple and clean and you're just left with the words. There are no distractions and only a connection between you and Leo's words &mdash; his thoughts.

Writing isn't an easy activity for me, but when I do write, I enjoy it very much. And I'd like to do more.

One of the things that keeps me from writing is this very site. As a person who designs and builds websites, I always see design tweaks and changes I can make. This gets in the way of the purpose of the site &mdash; to share my thoughts and words.

I'm inspired by Justin Jackson's [Words](http://justinjackson.ca/words.html). In it, he shares what the heart of web design should be.

> At its heart, web design should be about words. Words don't come after the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus.
>
> Start with words.

I've decided the path of least resistance to writing more is to remove distractions. To remove all the design and fluff of the site and simply focus on the words.

I'll start here, with words.
