I've been exploring Vim again lately and I stumbled across some of [June Gunn Choi's excellent work](https://github.com/junegunn).

He's created many useful and elegant Vim plugins, one of which is called goyo.vim, a distraction-free writing experience in Vim. Goyo reminds me a lot of [iA Writer on the Mac](https://ia.net/writer/mac/). All UI elements get out of the way so you can focus on simply writing.

If you're a Vim user and want a distraction-free writing experience, definitely checkout [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim).
