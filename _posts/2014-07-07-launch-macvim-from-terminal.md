To get support for yanking to my system's clipboard, I decided to download MacVim.

Out of the box, MacVim doesn't have support for opening a file from the command-line like _vim_ does.

Thankfully, MacVim comes packaged with a cli that enables you to open files in the terminal with _mvim_.

I've created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/michaellee/d155b9b9f26dedd0d9cc) detailing how to get it to work.
