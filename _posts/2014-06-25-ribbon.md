In a <a href="{{site.url}}/corner-banners/" target="_blank">previous post</a> I shared some pains I've faced about sites that used ribbons made out of images.

Since then I kept running into other sites that used them. Most of the problematic ones were with ribbons from GitHub. As a result I've created a simple HTML/CSS solution for folks to use. My solution is unobtrusive so it doesn't get in the way of the user's experience.

You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaellee/ribbon).
