I've been a big fan of Jekyll, a static-site generator made in Ruby, for a while. This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. Yesterday Jekyll reached version 3.0. While there wasn't any new feature that got me excited, the folks behind the project has created a Discourse site at [talk.jekyllrb.com](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) for fellow Jekyll-ers to talk about their Jekyll experiences. This is something that I'm pretty stoked about. The Jekyll community has always felt sparse for me. I'd run into other developer sites from time to time that claimed to run off of Jekyll but have never run into a central place for Jekyll users to come together as a community.

I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences and learning what others are building with Jekyll.
