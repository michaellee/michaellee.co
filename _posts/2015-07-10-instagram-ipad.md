> Instagram seems to be planning to upgrade photos to 1080px, according to source code from the Instagram website

I wonder if this is a sign that Instagram is prepping to make their iOS app universal and support the iPad. That's the first thought I had when I saw this article. I think Instagram would get a huge increase in users outside their current target audience &mdash; which seems to be high schoolers and young adults. There's been many times I've gone to celebrations, tourist destinations and events and have seen older folks holding up their iPads to snap a photo.

I would love to see Instagram's take on what their app would look like on an iPad. We shall see what's up their sleeves.
