This past year, I wrote a lot of posts on programming. Mainly the things, I've been learning on a day to day basis. I enjoyed doing this because I love [learning new things and sharing](http://michaellee.co/quest-teach-learn/) the things that I'm learning with others.

But as I wrote more and more about programming, I noticed that the frequency in which I wrote about the _other aspects_ of my life were missing from this site.

Aspects that I find important and I want to share those areas of my life as well. Things like nurturing a community, making products, online business, eating healthy and being a family man. These things are important to me as well as my journey as a programmer.

For this reason, I've decided to do a little bit of a reboot to my site. I'll continue to share programming tips and tidbits, but they will be found on [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io) &mdash; an online community I've been building to help programmers of all skills to level up their craft.

For the past few months I've been writing code tips every weekday on CodeHive. This is part of a personal goal of sharing 100 tips on CodeHive.You can follow along on [Twitter on the official CodeHive account](https://twitter.com/codehiveio) or follow over at [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io/tags/100CodeTips).

The focus of this site will be for those other things I've listed above. This is a response to the fact that much of my life has changed this past year. I've become a father and [I'm now freelancing](http://michaellee.co/my-last-and-first-day/).

If any of this resonates with you, than I'm glad you're here and look forward to having conversations about these things. If you'd like to get updates from me, [sign up for blog posts via email](http://eepurl.com/-zz01), or [connect with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellomichaellee).

Man, writing this article felt good.

Cheers!
