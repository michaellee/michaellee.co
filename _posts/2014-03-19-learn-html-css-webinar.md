Can I share a frustration I've had about myself? I've been wanting to teach since <a href="{{ site.url }}/quest-teach-learn" target="_blank">relaunching my site</a>, almost a year ago. And I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't done much to make that desire a reality.

I've made excuses that I don't have time, I don't know enough to teach or that people won't enjoy learning from me, so why start? I've made so many excuses that has kept me from trying and seeing if I'm even good at teaching or have something worth teaching.

Tonight, I'm tired of being frustrated and making excuses. Tonight, I've decided to embark on the journey to teach and I've decided to commit to it for a month.

For the next month I've decided to teach the basics of building a website which is HTML and CSS. The only way to get the ball rolling and create a sense of urgency is to set hard deadlines and set expectations.

So to start off this month long journey to see if I've got the chops to teach, I'm holding my very first live webinar next Tuesday. And the best part of this webinar is that it will be __absolutely free!__

More details about the webinar and a <a href="{{ site.url }}/learn-html-css-webinar/#mc-embedded-subscribe-form">sign up form</a> are below.
