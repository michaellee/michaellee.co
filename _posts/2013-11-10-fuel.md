The other night while I was putting fuel into my car, I read a small sign about how the fuel that I was pumping would also clean the gunk built up from other not so "premium" fuel.

I can't seem to tell a difference by using this brand of fuel in my car, but the sign did get me thinking about the type of fuel I put in myself.

Every moment it seems, our attention is demanded in so many different places. Thanks to the internet I've got so many distractions that dilutes my focus.

There's been many times I've set aside a few hours to do some work, programming or to learn; only to come to the end of those hours and realize that I had gotten none of the things that I had set out to do done.

This then leads me to feeling unaccomplished and more unmotivating activities -- more web-browsing, watching tv or playing games.

I've been intentionally setting aside about 30 mins to an hour each day to studying a book on iPhone programming. During this time, I don't check email, browse the web or even look at my phone. So that the fuel I put into myself can carry me through the day or give me the spark to do other productive things throughout the day.
