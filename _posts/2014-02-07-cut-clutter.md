I admit I'm not the most tidiest person in the world, but the one place where I can't stand clutter is my desk.

Perhaps it's because it's the one place where I spend most of my time during the day. I find that when my desk is cluttered, my mind also feels cluttered.

So before I start anything at my desk, I cut clutter.

I also enjoy seeing other people's desks/workspaces. Most of which I envy, because they look so inspiring.

Perhaps one day my desk or workspace will be worthy of sharing with the world, until then here are some desks/workspaces that I think are pretty awesomesauce.
