> We act as if how you live and how you work are separate things, when really, separating the two is like trying to pull apart a ball of rubber bands—they’re so intertwined that you can’t get one without at least part of the other.

I'm nodding my head so hard in agreement. As this is something I've learned to cope with as a stay-at-home father. Both work and family are part of my life. I have tried to separate the two but it has always become messy. Both aspects are a part of who I am. The more I allow both to ebb and flow throughout my day makes me happier. Working to separate the two, just stresses everyone out.
