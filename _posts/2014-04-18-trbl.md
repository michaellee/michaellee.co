When I ran my [live webinar to teach HTML and CSS](http://michaellee.co/learn-html-css-webinar/), there was a point in the lesson where I was trying to explain box modeling. Particularly I was trying to explain properties such as margin and padding. How you can group multiple values into a single property.

So a style block like this:

```css
element {
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 5px;
  padding-bottom: 3px;
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```

Could be written as this:

```scss
element{
  padding: 10px 5px 3px 5px;
}
```

The order in which you write the values in the single property goes clockwise from top, to right, to bottom then to left.

[Jess Martin](https://twitter.com/jessmartin), who was in the audience mentioned he used the acronym, TRBL to remember the order. I thought it was great because it was so easy to remember.

The acronym stuck with me so well, I decided to create a simple code illustration that visually maps a box element with its corresponding value in a property.
