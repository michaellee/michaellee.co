I've been using an app called Over for a while now. It is a sweet photo app on iOS that allows you to *over*lay (you see what I did there?) text and graphics and such to your photos. Today, Over released version 3 of their app and I am stoked!

Over now has access to the [free stockphoto library over at Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). I think this is huge for those who are building their brand on Instagram. I save trinkets of quotes all the time and try to share them on [my own Instagram account](https://instagram.com/hellomichaellee/).

Before I would slave over looking through all of Unsplash's photos, download them, load up [Pixelmator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12&at=11l9EG), add the quote, save and then [Dropbox](https://db.tt/gXa6Jfi) them over to my phone and then post them on Instagram.

Now with Over 3, I just fire up the app, choose a photo, copy and paste my quote and simply share my creation over to Instagram. All within the app. That was like 3 steps vs the gajillion that I had before. Mad time saver. I'm a fan!

If you've never used [Over](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/over/id535811906?mt=8&at=11l9EG) before, I highly suggest you check it out!
