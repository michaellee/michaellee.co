> I'm having a good day because I'm making dollars.

While waiting for my breakfast order the other day at Panera Bread, I was greeted by a guy who had just walked out of the back with some clean dishes.

He asked how I was doing and I replied that I was doing well.

I asked how he was doing and with the biggest smile, he replied, "I'm having a good day becasue I'm making dollars".

He didn't have to say anymore, his demeanor said it all. He was geninely happy and was glad to have a job that paid him dollars.

This made me reflect on my job. Not only does my job give me the opportunity to grow in my career but also provides me with the financial ability to care for my family.

For this I am thankful.

Thanks Panera Bread dude for that reminder.
