I'm a fan of Twitter. I love the fact that there is a 140 character limit. It forces me to focus on the meat of what I'm trying to convey and cut out all the unncessary stuff. I have to be concise, which means every character counts to get the thought across.

I'm a fan of Seth Godin's blog. He shares very short posts every day and it cuts to the core of what he is trying to say. Today's post was about [how to start your first business](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/12/where-to-start.html) and it was less than 300 characters. Yet it was concise and the message was communicated well.

I wonder if placing certain constraints on your craft can make you better? I think I'll try that with writing on this site. Limit the character count and see if I become better at communicating my thoughts.
