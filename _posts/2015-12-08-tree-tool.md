title: Tree command line tool

I just discovered a neat little command line tool called tree. What tree does is list the content of directories in a tree-like format. This is super useful if you want to quickly share a visual representation of a project's file structure.

To install tree on Mac OS X, you could use hombrew and run `brew install tree`.

Once installed you can run `tree` and it'll recursively print out the file structure for the current folder you are in.

tree has a lot of options that makes it super flexible on what you want it to print out. Such as `tree -L 1 --dirsfirst`. What this commands does is limits the depth of the tree to 1 level and prints directories before files.

What you'll get is something like this:

```
.
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _sass
├── css
├── _config.yml
├── about.md
├── feed.xml
└── index.html
```
