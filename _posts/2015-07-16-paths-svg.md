I'm a big fan of Brent Jackson's work. I use his CSS library, [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) in many of my web projects. Today I discovered Paths, a browser-based SVG editor that looks pretty phenomenal.

One of the things I sometimes have a hard time keeping track of when writing SVGs by hand is keeping track of the various coordinates in my head. With this editor, you can just focus on the graphic instead of all the points.
