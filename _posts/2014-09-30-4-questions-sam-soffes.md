I came across this post by Sam Soffes answer four questions that a college student had for him regarding being a developer. I'm glad he publicly shared these questions and answers as it is refreshing to read someone's origin story. And it could be helpful to a whole bunch of folks.

This excerpt in particular was something I took away from the post:

> Still to this day, my attitude is “sure, I can figure this out.” Being resourceful instead of giving up when you get stuck the most important thing you can. I think this is what makes the difference between a good programmer and a great programmer (resourcefulness and that attitude that you can figure it out that is).
