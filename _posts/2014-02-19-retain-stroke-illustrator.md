After you've finished your design in Illustrator, you might want to scale down your design to a smaller size. But in doing you might realize that Illustrator is scaling but not scaling the line widths of your design in proportion; so you get something like the gif below.

To fix this and have the line widths scale in proportion to the whole design and retain detail, go to __Illustrator > Preferences > General...__. Then select the __General__ option in the left column menu and make sure to check _Scale Strokes & Effects_.

Now when you scale your design, you should see your lines retaining it's stroke width in proportion.
