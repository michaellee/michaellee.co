Little by little bit, everyday.

I have a tendency to want to see results quickly. 

And when I don't see the results that I'm expecting, in the time frame in which I think it should take, I get really disappointed.

During times like these, I've come to realize that I simply need to push back, see the big picture and keep trucking along little by little bit. Even if the milestones are smaller, I need to realize that these small milestones will eventually add up and paint the big picture in which I've set out to make.

By simply taking a step back, I'm able to cut out unnecessary features or details and focus on the essence of what I'm trying to make or achieve.
