I first discovered designer, Kelli Anderson's work in Tinybop's app, _The Human Body_. Immediately I was entranced at the intricate details and animations Kelli was able to capture of the human body and its systems with paper.

Today, I stumbled across an interview of Kelli on _The Great Discontent_ and I really enjoyed reading her journey in becoming a designer, her process when working on new projects and her interests in things other then design &ndash; like physics.

There was one particular quote by Kelli I couldn't agree with enough and is how I've discovered I learn best.

> People learn best when they are dropped in a foreign country and their survival depends on their learning the language. All knowledge is like thisâ€”you learn best when you need it.

I'm currently building my first iOS application and it's a great example of Kelli's quote. I've been trying to learn Objective-C and iOS programming for years. With each attempt, I would read books, go through tutorials but nothing seemed to really stick.

Having just learned some Ember.js by jumping head-first in building <a href="http://michaellee.co/tap-and-click" target="_blank">Tap and Click</a>, I decided that if I want to successfully learn how to make iOS apps I would have to just build one.

The amount I learn from just diving into building an actual app is exponential. If you're trying to learn to program, I can't recommend enough a head-first approach.
