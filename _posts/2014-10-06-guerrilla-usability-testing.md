Today, I was tasked to start prepping to run a usability test of a project at work. I've done some basic usability tests when I was in an HCI course and then again in my human factors course. But I needed a refresher.

I came across this presentation by a guy named John Chan. Looking over the slides, he shares about how to run your own guerilla usability test. There's definitely some good tips on how to run your own tests and great examples build as a foundation in the presentation.
