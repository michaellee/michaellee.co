When I decided to redesign my website, I knew I wanted to concentrate on two things for the layout &mdash; content and focus. The meat of my website comes from my writing and that's what you should get.

If I'm comparing my site with food, it's like going to a super fancy, upscale restaurant for steak. The restaurant's job is to prepare and provide the best piece of steak that they can provide. The thing about steak is that all you really need is the meat to make an awesome steak. Of course you could add sides, but it should only complement the dish not distract away from it. If a steak is truly great, it could stand on its own and you wouldn't need anything else.

In the same way that nothing should come in the way of the taste of the steak, I expect the same for the experience. If I'm going to a fancy restaurant for steak, I don't want to fill up on salad and bread. I came for steak. For an awesome experience, I want my steak as quick as possible. Only after I've had my steak, then can you offer some dessert and maybe a box of matches to keep reminding me of the place I had an awesome steak.

Now that I've got you hungry for steak, let me jump into the meat of this post. The details of the redesign.

## Breathing room

With the new layout, I wanted to give the content room to breath.

## Easy to read

I'm not sure if this is a result of aging, but these days I've noticed that I'm more likely to read an entire article on a website if the width of the paragraphs are narrower. If you look at a physical book, margins are intentionally put on a page to limit the length of a line. [Doing some research](http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability), I discovered that there are benefits to doing this.

Limiting the length of a line creates a rhythm for the reader. When a reader jumps to the next line, the subconscious mind is reenergized as long as the jump doesn't occur too frequently. Limiting the length of a line also makes it easier for a reader to gauge where a line starts and ends, thus reducing stress.

It turns out that the optimal number of characters for the ideal line length is **50-75** characters. To achieve this, in my layout, I've set my font-size to 20 pixels while the width of the paragraph is 500 pixels wide.

Meanwhile, I also wanted to visually excite the reader when I included images in my posts. From the image above, you'll see that images exceed beyond the 500 pixels line width. I've chosen for images to be 550 pixels wide. During my experiments with the layout, I've found that it was large enough to provide some visual difference from the text and not detracting from the flow of the text.

## Guidance
This aspect of the redesign was tough for me &mdash; guiding a reader through an experience on my website. I'm not able to control how a reader gets to my website, but I do have some control over how the reader experiences my website once they are there. This is an area that I had to really think through. In doing so, I've had to learn to cut out clutter.

In the past I thought that providing the reader with as many links as possible to other parts of my website would increase engagement with my brand. But as you can see from this image below, my assumptions lead to a really messy footer.

In the screenshot above, I've counted ten possible actions the reader could take action on once they finish reading a post on my site. That's one too many options. Really there should be one, perhaps two at most actions that the user should take. To increase the engagement of my readers with my website, I've decided to focus on building an email list.

An email list will allow me to provide information in a person's inbox and an email makes it super easy for a reader and I to enter into a dialogue regarding a post, all they need to do is simply hit reply. For this reason, I've made an email sign up a major focus at the end of each post.

I've purposely made the newsletter sign up stand out by adding a background color and a nice shiny color button to catch a person's attention. I'm almost tempted to remove all other footer links so that the reader is left with really three options. Either navigate to a different site, scroll back up or sign up for the newsletter.

I also want to do some split testing to see which newsletter sign up does better. I've heard that making a user click on an actual button first, then showing a form yields higher sign ups. I'm a bit skeptical about this since I believe most readers are used to the form being made available immediately, so that all they have to do is enter in their information and hit submit.

======

When I write for my website, I'm doing my best to provide the best information that I can provide. This comes from a genuine desire to provide value for the readers of my site. In order to keep providing the best information that I can provide, I'm constantly learning and becoming better at my craft so that you get the best possible information possible.
