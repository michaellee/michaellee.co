Last Friday we found out we're having a son. Soon I realized my son will be trilingual. To make sure my wife and son don't scheme against me in German, I need to learn how to speak it. I'll be chronicling my journey in learning German by writing short phrases to and about our son. The posts will probably start with, Mein Sohn which means my son in German.

Wish me luck.
