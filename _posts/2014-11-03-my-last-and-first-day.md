Today, is my last day at NC State Universty as the Senior Web Developer. Although the time has been short, it was a time of learning, challenges and growth with some great people.

I won't go into great detail as to why I'm leaving, but will share, it has been a desire of mine for a very long time to carve out more time in my day to spend with my wife and my son.

For this reason, I've lined up some freelancing projects and have decided not to join another company. If you're interested in working with me, [hit me up](mailto:hellomichaellee@gmail.com) and I'd love to hear about your web projects!

I've also wanted to give my passions &mdash; <a href="https://www.codehive.io" target="_blank">CodeHive</a> and <a href="http://www.nativehaus.com" target="_blank">Native Haus</a> &mdash; more room to grow.

There is so much work to be done with CodeHive. Christopher and I have so many ideas and desires to where we would like to see the community going and the tools we could create to enable folks to level up their skill sets. CodeHive is the community we've always wanted to be part of as we embarked on our journey as developers.

Native Haus is more than just a paper goods company. Native Haus is the story of my family. I'm beginning to realize that the story we have to share, is both unique and relatable with others. I want to tell our stories and create products that reflect our story.

The road ahead is exciting but I know will also require a lot of work. I will document as much as I can here on my site with hope that it will help others who are embarking on a similar journey.

Here's to today, my last day at NC State and my first day being on my own.
