With the season that I am in, I feel the need to refocus. The need to focus my time and my energy.

I've had to assess for myself what is most important at this very moment and learn to simply say no, so that I may put my time and energy in the important things.

This isn't easy for me but I know it is necessary. I have the tendency to lose focus but by saying no, it allows me to stay focused.

Don't deplete your limited time and energy on what is not important but channel it to what is.
