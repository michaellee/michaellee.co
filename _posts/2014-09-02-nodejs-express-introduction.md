In the past couple of days I've been trying to wrap my head around Node.js and the Express framework. I've only been able to find a handful of useful articles that has helped me dive in. One of which is this article by lover of Sriracha, [Evan Hahn](https://twitter.com/EvanHahn).

If you're looking for an article to get your bearings in Node.js and Express, I recommend checking out Evan's. As of this writing, Express is at version 4.8.7. The article was written when version 4 was first released so, some things may be done a little differently now then what is described in the article.

Nonetheless, it's a good way to dive into Node and Express, so check it out.
