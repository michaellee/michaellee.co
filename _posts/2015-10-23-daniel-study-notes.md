I came across Daniel's study notes while familiarizing myself with tmux and vim. Daniel as a way of teaching himself new things, found that doing research on how it works, writing a tutorial for himself that covers main concepts and then posting them online for reference was the best way for him to learn. This is a method that I found helpful too and often do on [CodeHive](https://www.codehive.io/).

I'm glad he did, because he's got some very good study notes on [tmux](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/), [vim](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) and even [coffee](https://danielmiessler.com/study/coffee/). If you're looking to pick up some knowledge on any of those topics have a peek at his study notes.
