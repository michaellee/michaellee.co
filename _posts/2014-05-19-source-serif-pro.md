Source Serif Pro is a new font released by Adobe to complement the Source Sans Pro font family. I can't wait to pair the two font's together in a future project as Source Sans Pro is a font I've been delighting in these days.

I like the project page for two reasons. First, the GitHub [corner banner](http://michaellee.co/corner-banners/) in the upper right is made with markup and css; so it doesn't interfere with my navigation of the site. Second, it uses a HTML5 tag attribute called contenteditable that I've never known about. <a href="http://html5doctor.com/the-contenteditable-attribute/" target="_blank">contenteditable</a> makes everything contained in an element with the attribute editable within the browser.

I thought it was clever to use contenteditable in this context since it allows for users to live edit some text and take the font for a test-drive.
