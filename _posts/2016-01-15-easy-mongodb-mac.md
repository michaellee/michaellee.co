All of the Ruby on Rails web applications that my partner, Christopher and I have built use a PostgreSQL database. On the Mac, [PostgreSQL.app](https://github.com/postgresapp/postgresapp) has made it easy to quickly get started with PostgreSQL. Simply download, drag and drop and double click on the app icon and you've got PostgreSQL running on your system.

Lately, I've been delving into some Node and Express and wondered if there was a PostgreSQL.app-esque equivalent for MongoDB. Doing a quick Google search, and I was happy to see that there is such an app called, [MongoDB.app](https://github.com/gcollazo/mongodbapp). Just like PostgreSQL.app, you simply download, drag and drop and double click on the app icon and you've got MongoDB running on your system.
