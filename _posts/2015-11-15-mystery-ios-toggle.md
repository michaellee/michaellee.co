Tonight as I was writing on my iPad, it kept locking on me while it was propped up on its cover. Annoyed, I remembered that in the settings there was a setting to turn this off. I went looking for it and couldn't find it anywhere. What I did find was this one toggle that didn't have any label on it other than **Lock/Unlock**.

Unsure about what it does, I tried toggling it on and off and it didn't seem to do anything. So I took to Google to see if I could figure out where this cover lock feature was that I used so long ago. What I found was an old photo of the setting that had the same grouping of settings like the ones in the photo above. Only difference was, where I have a **Lock/Unlock** the photo had **iPad Cover Lock/Unlock**.

I went back to that setting and gave it a shot and sure enough, the iPad didn't lock anymore when it was leaned against the cover. I'm not sure how long it has been like this, but I'm using iOS 9.1 the label for the setting is like this.
