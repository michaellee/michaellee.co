Last night I checked out Assembly's newish product called, [Changelog](http://changelog.assembly.com/). I signed up, created a couple of changelogs and started to tweak my changelogs to make it more custom.

One of the first things I did was try to upload a logo for a changelog. It didn't work. At first I thought it was because I had uploaded a PNG instead of a JPG. So I uploaded a JPG and still nothing.

There was no mention of file type, resolution or size requirements so I just thought, "ok it's broken I'll let them know". So I backtracked to one of the first pages you see when you sign up.

![Changelog's welcome message]({{site.url}}/assets/images/20150702-assembly.png)

Which has a little welcome message and a permission to let them know if something is off (poor Christine). So I sent an e-mail regarding my troubles and just to double up and make sure I'm heard I took to Twitter and also sent a tweet to @asm.

Within the hour, @asm tweeted me back and the Head of Products tweeted to say they've fixed the bug &mdash; awesome.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hellomichaellee">@hellomichaellee</a> we&#39;re on it</p>&mdash; Assembly (@asm) <a href="https://twitter.com/asm/status/616458625884684288">July 2, 2015</a></blockquote>

As far as the e-mail goes, it doesn't matter now because the problem is fixed. But it amazes me how fast support is given nowadays thanks to social media.

Lesson to be learned: If you're a business of any size, be on social media and care when folks tweet about your product/service. When you show love, the consumer will most likely respond with the equivalent of social media's like or heart by loving you back and sticking with your brand.

Thanks to social media my support request didn't get lost in the queue of someone's inbox, instead it bubbled up in front of someone's face to be dealt quickly.
