On Monday, Apple announced a slew of new features for their latest iOS and OS X updates. One feature I'm pretty stoked about is Quicktime's ability to capture real-time footage of iOS apps straight from your iPhone.

Paired with _App Previews_ in the App Store, it'll help app consumers get a better feel of an app before making a purchase.

I can also see this as a way to really enhance app reviews and sharing of app tips and tricks. I predict the near future will be filled with great demo videos and even gifs explaining app features.
