response: "Do you consume more than you produce? How about joining me and producing more than you consume? If you're in let me know on Twitter"

I've recently come to the realization that I consume a lot of stuff online. And for the most part the stuff isn't even that good. I check Facebook, Twitter, Instagram like a bajillion times a day and it's the same old stuff over and over again.

Then I had a thought, "What if I produced more than I consumed?". Instead of consuming stuff I don't really care about, how about I take all those times I tap open Facebook in a day and consolidate it into a time that I actually create something valuable for others and myself?

Now it ain't going to be easy. Because my idea runway only goes so far but I think it'll be a good challenge.

I will start this challenge by producing two things per week. This might come in the form of a tutorial, a blog post or maybe even a video. I'm not really sure what it'll be but I'll post it on my site. I've chosen to create two things per week because producing something once per week doesn't seem like much of a challenge, but twice per week seems like a tangible goal to start getting in a rhythm of producing.
