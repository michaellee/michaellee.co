I'm a big fan of [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com). I've owned a pair of the [Bensen](https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/men/bensen/whiskey-tortoise) and plan on picking up another pair soon. Recently I visited the site and was pleasantly surprised to see this:

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20160119-digital-slap.gif" style="border: 1px solid #f3f3f3; display: inline-block;">
</div>

I like to call it their *Digital Slap Simulator* but really it is a cool way to use the mouse's hover effect to show a customer what a pair of glasses look like on a real human being's face. I'll admit, I spent a good half a minute quickly moving my cursor across the dude's face. Not because I didn't like the guy's face, but because I was admiring this little feature.

Definitely worth checking out for yourself. Just click on any frames and scroll down till you see the heading **About the frames** right next to the description of the frame you'll see a face with the frames on. Hover your cursor over the face and watch it rotate.
