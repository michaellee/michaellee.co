## Navigating

These should be performed in *command mode*.

`h` Move to the left

`l` Move to the right

`j` Move up

`k` Move down

## Editing

`>>` Indent line by shiftwidth spaces. shiftwidth is defined in a .vimrc file.

`[1-9]>>` Indents line by shiftwidth spaces starting from the line your cursor is currently on. So if I did `3>>` this would shift the current line plus the 2 followng lines
